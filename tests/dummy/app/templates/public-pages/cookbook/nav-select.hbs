<h1 class="doc-page-title">Datepicker</h1>

<p>
  A couple people asked me if I was considering adding a feature present in the well known
  <a href="http://dbushell.github.io/Pikaday/">Pickaday</a> library where you can click in
  the month or year to quicky navigate to far away dates.
</p>

<p>
  The answer I gave was that I wasn't considering it, but not because I don't think it is a good
  pattern, but because the flexible nature of Ember Power Calendar makes it unnecesary!
</p>

<p>
  Let's build it in a few lines of code.
</p>

{{#code-sample js="nav-select-1-js.js" hbs="nav-select-1.hbs" css="nav-select-1-css.css" as |partialName|}}
  {{partial partialName}}
{{/code-sample}}

<p>
  Ok, let's disect what is going on here.
</p>

<p>
  We pass a block to the <code>calendar.nav</code> component to replace the default markup with the name of the component
  with our own markup. In that markup we add two invisible select on top of the text of the month and year that
  when interacted call an action that builds a new date and pass it to <code>calendar.actions.changeCenter</code> public action
  to center the calendar on that action.
</p>

<p>
  The markup itself is a bit verbose because we're coding a select outselves, but the logic is easy to follow.
</p>

<p>
  Ember Power Calendar prefers to let users enhance the calendar themselves instead of attempting to
  imagine all the possible scenarios.
</p>

<p>
  What if you prefer to use Ember Power Select instead of a native select?
</p>

{{!-- {{#code-sample js="nav-select-2-js.js" hbs="nav-select-2.hbs" as |partialName|}} --}}
{{#code-sample hbs="nav-select-2.hbs" as |partialName|}}
  {{partial partialName}}
{{/code-sample}}

<p>
  Or maybe a text input

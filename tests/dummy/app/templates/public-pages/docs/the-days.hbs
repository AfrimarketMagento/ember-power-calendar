<h1 class="doc-page-title">The days</h1>

<p>
  A calendar is basically a list of days, typically (although not necessarily)
  displayed in a grid with 7 columns. So the first thing you might want to customize is
  the content of each day.
</p>

<h3>Passing a block</h3>

<p>
  There is many ways of doing it, but the simplest one is passing a block that will be
  the content of each cell of the grid. It's not the most versatile but can be used for
  simple customizations.
</p>

<p>
  The block receives two arguments. The first one is a useful day object and the second is the
  public API of the component. You can check the API of both objects <a href="/docs/api-reference">API reference</a> section.
</p>

<p>
  Let's start by making the number of the days of the weeked be strong and pink, because we like weekends.

{{#code-sample hbs="the-days-1.hbs" as |partialName|}}
  {{partial partialName}}
{{/code-sample}}

<p>
  Many of the properties of the day object are designed to make the most usual customizations

<h1 class="doc-page-title">How to use it</h1>

<p>
  The basic component usage is very simple. There is no mandatory fields. Just invoke the component and you will get
  a nice calendar.
</p>

{{#code-sample hbs="how-to-use-it-1.hbs" as |partialName|}}
  {{partial partialName}}
{{/code-sample}}

<p>
  Nice, but not very interesting. The calendar is smart enough to display the current month but that's it.
</p>

<h3><code>displayedMonth</code></h3>

<p>
  To make the calendar show render on a different month, just pass <code>displayedMonth=someDate</code>, and the calendar will
  display the month of that date.
  It doesn't mater if it's the 1st day or the 31st. Let's render October of 2013.
</p>

{{#code-sample hbs="how-to-use-it-2.hbs" js="how-to-use-it-2-js.js" as |partialName|}}
  {{partial partialName}}
{{/code-sample}}

<p>
  Oh, and by the way, this component speaks native <code>Date</code> and <code>MomentJS</code>.
  You can pass any, at your best convenience. The same is true for all options that take a date.
</p>

<h3><code>selected</code></h3>

<p>
  Sometimes you want a day of the month to be highlighted. To do it pass <code>selected=someDate</code> to the component.
</p>

{{#code-sample hbs="how-to-use-it-3.hbs" js="how-to-use-it-3-js.js" as |partialName|}}
  {{partial partialName}}
{{/code-sample}}

<p>
  You can see that the calendar shows the selected date in a different shade of gray. Besides, you might also have noticed that
  the despite just passing a <code>selected</code> option, the month is not the current one. That is because, in the
  absence of a specific <code>displayedMonth</code>, the calendar will show the month of the selected date. But take into account
  that if both options are provided, <code>displayedMonth</code> <strong>always</strong> prevails.
</p>

<p>
  Enough for static calendars. If you just wanted to display a static grid of days you probably wouldn't be using an ember-addon for that.
  You want to navigate months, you want to select days and ranges. Let's see how to do this things in the next chapter.
